- Accent color: Sky blue (#0EA5E9) to highlight interactive elements and actions.

- Use a fluid, responsive layout that adapts to both mobile and desktop screens. Implement a 'mobile first' approach for optimal viewing on smaller devices.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent players and actions on the board. Consistent with the Apple Design style. 
- Implement subtle animations when dragging and dropping players, with gentle transitions to enhance the user experience.
